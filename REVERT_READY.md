# 🔧 AUTOMATED REVERT SCRIPT

## Instructions:

This document lists all the specific changes that need to be reverted.
I can automatically perform these reverts for you.

---

## To Revert All Changes:

**Simply say:** "Revert all UI enhancements" or "Restore to original"

I will automatically:
1. ✅ Remove the `utils/ui_effects.py` file
2. ✅ Remove all import statements for ui_effects
3. ✅ Remove all `add_button_hover_effect()` calls
4. ✅ Change button relief from `raised` back to `flat`
5. ✅ Remove unnecessary `bd` parameters
6. ✅ Remove unnecessary `cursor='hand2'` where not needed

---

## Current State:

**Enhanced Version** (Current):
- ✅ Modern hover effects on all buttons
- ✅ Professional look with raised buttons
- ✅ Smooth color transitions
- ✅ Better visual feedback

**Original Version** (Before Enhancement):
- ⚪ No hover effects
- ⚪ Flat button style
- ⚪ Simple appearance
- ⚪ Basic functionality

---

## Safety:

- ✅ **No data loss** - Only UI changes
- ✅ **No logic changes** - Functionality remains identical
- ✅ **Reversible** - Can re-apply enhancements anytime
- ✅ **Tested** - Original code worked fine before

---

## Alternative: Keep Enhancements, Fix Issues

If you're experiencing specific issues, I can also:
- Fix specific buttons that look wrong
- Adjust colors or hover effects
- Keep some enhancements, remove others
- Fine-tune the appearance

**Just describe the issue and I'll fix it!**

## Status: READY TO REVERT

**Command:** Say "revert" and I'll restore everything to original state.

**Time Required:** ~30 seconds

**Risk Level:** None - Just UI changes
